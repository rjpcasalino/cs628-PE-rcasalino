## City U of Seattle TODO List

I created this TODO app following MDN guide as it included things we learned in class thus far. I also wrote another TODO that did use reducer. I felt this app was cleaner code so I am submitting this TODO rather than the one that used the reducer. Otherwise, I still feel that React can be rather verbose and state management is a clearly a headache when things get bigger and more complicated.



# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh
